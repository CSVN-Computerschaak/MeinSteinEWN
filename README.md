# MeinStein Connect6 Release 2009

This MeinStein Connect6 release contains the code as left by Theo van der 
Storm (1960- 2009) for his Connect6 program. The program won silver in the 
2007 (Amsterdam) and 2009 (Pamplona) Computer Games Olympiad as organised 
by the ICGA.

Together with Theo's family it was decided to give other people to see the
work of Theo and learn from it. Therefore the code is opened up through the
website of the CSVN (Dutch Computer Chess Federation). Theo played a important
part in organizing tournaments for the CSVN, nearly 25 Dutch Computer Chess
Championships and 6 International CSVN tournaments. Not only chess had his
attention, his Stormy chess program competed in the early 1980s in the Dutch 
Championship, but also with "Einstein Wuerfelt Nicht!" and Connect6.

A "Stormy's Corner" download area has been created on the website of the
CSVN. Here you can find the programs Theo has created over the years. The
idea is that other people can learn from the legacy of Theo.

Theo, thanks!!

P.S. If you use this program in any way, refer to Theo and what you learned
from the program :-)
